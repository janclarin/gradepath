# GradePath

**An Android application that keeps track of weighted grades, courses over several semesters. All of the data is stored in an SQLite database.**

It is currently available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.janclarin.gradepath).

## Why?
I could not find an Android application that supported keeping track of weighted grades and calculating them, so I decided to make my own. GradePath was the first serious Android application I have ever written, excluding several practice applications I have tinkered with in the past.

I also took it as a chance to play with the Android SDK and work with relational databases, all while learning the basics of git in the process. The commits are definitely messy in retrospect, where I was committing files that were not actually changed for that commit. However, as of late, I have learned how to use git properly.

### Over the process, I learned how to:
*   Use the Listener pattern to send information between Activities and Fragments
*   Populate ListViews from the SQLite database using custom adapters
*   Create custom view layouts for Activities, Fragments, and Dialogs using XML and different ViewGroup layouts
*   Work with the Navigation Drawer to provide a slide-out menu to navigate through the app
*   Apply Google's design guidelines, namely Material Design
*   Use the Google Play Developer Console to publish the application with alpha and beta versions
*   Respond to feedback from friends and push updates to the app
